puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}" # pumpkins bc/ The String#+= operation is re-assignment and creates a new String object. The reference to this new object is assigned to a_string_param. The local variable a_string_param now points to "pumpkinsrutabaga", not "pumpkins". It has been re-assigned by the String#+= operation. This means that a_string_param and my_string no longer point to the same object.
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}" # pumpkins, rutabaga bc/ When we attach an additional element to an array using the << operator, Ruby simply keeps using the same object that was passed in, and appends the new element to it.

# So, because the local variable an_array_param still points to the original object, the local variables my_array and an_array_param are still pointing at the same object, and we see the results of what happened to the array "outside" of the method.
